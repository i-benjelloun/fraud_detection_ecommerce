# Detection of fraudulent transactions 

## Introduction
E-commerce sites carry a lot of money. This can lead to significant risks of fraudulent activities, such as using stolen credit cards, money laundering, etc.

Fortunately, Machine Learning can help us identify these fraudulent activities. All websites where you have to enter your payment information have a team that deals with fraud risks via ML.

The goal of this challenge is to build a model that allows you to predict the probability of a fraudulent transaction.
